# ECE 539 Artificial Neural Networks Final Project - Sentiment Analysis in Natural Language Processing
Program that prompts the user for text to classify, which is processed by removing punctuation characters and numbers. The processed text is then fed into a language classifier, which returns the language of the text if it is in our scope of English, Spanish, Hindi, French, or Arabic languages. Once the language is classified, the text is moved into a sentiment analysis classifier that attempts to determine if the text has negative or positive connotation. If the language cannot be detected, the program displays a brief message indicating that the user input is not supported by our program.
